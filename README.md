# Mid_term_project

**Project participants:** 
- James Kenny
- Matthew Batchelor

**Goal of the project:** 

We would like to build a model that predicts user ratings for wine based on the attributes of the wine. 
We will examine the following input variables across 4898 instances: 

1. fixed_acidity	
2. volatile_acidity	
3. citric_acid	
4. residual_sugar	
5. chlorides	
6. free_sulfur_dioxide	
7. total_sulfur_dioxide	
8. density	
9. pH	
10. sulphates

Our output variable is a score between 0 and 10. 

**Week plan**

*Pre-work*

**Dataset selection** Choose a compelling dataset 

**Dataset Search & Evaluation:** Verify the dataset size, quality, and relevance. Ensure it's suitable for linear regression analysis.

*Monday* 

**Overview Presentation:** Present project idea, covering the chosen topic, dataset, and what we intend to explore or predict with our linear regression model. Gather feedback to refine our approach if needed.

**Dataset Search & Evaluation:** Verify the dataset size, quality, and relevance. Ensure it's suitable for linear regression analysis.

**Initial Data Exploration:** Conduct a quick exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's structure, variables, and any apparent trends or issues like missing values.

**Detailed EDA:** Dive deeper into the data to uncover patterns, correlations, and distributions. Identify potential features for our linear regression model.

**Data Cleaning:** Address missing values, outliers, and incorrect data types. Ensure the dataset is clean and ready for further analysis.

*Tuesday* 

**Data Preprocessing:**  Based on our EDA, prepare the data for modeling. This may include feature engineering, normalization or standardization of variables, and encoding categorical features.

**Model Development:** Begin with simple linear regression models to establish a baseline. Experiment with different feature combinations and model parameters.

*Wednesday*

**Model Refinement:** Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., RÂ², RMSE). Adjust our model by adding, removing, or transforming features as necessary.

**Validation:** Perform cross-validation to ensure your model's reliability and generalizability to unseen data.

*Thursday* 

**Final Analysis:** Interpret the model results to draw meaningful conclusions. Identify key predictors and their impact on the target variable.

**Presentation Drafting:** Start compiling our results, insights, and methodology into a coherent presentation. Include visualizations that clearly communicate our findings.

**Finalization Phase** Finalize our presentation and rehearse for the final presentation.

*Friday*

**Deliver our Presentation:** Confidently present our project, articulating the problem, the approach, key findings, and the implications of your results. Engage with our audience during the Q&A session to address their questions and feedback.
